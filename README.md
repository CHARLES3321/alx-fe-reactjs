React is a **JavaScript library** for building user interfaces, primarily used for developing single-page applications (SPAs). It was developed by Facebook and is now open-source. React is component-based, allowing developers to create reusable UI elements, making the code modular and easier to maintain.

Key features of React include:

- **Virtual DOM**: Enhances performance by minimizing direct interactions with the real DOM.
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Breaks UI into reusable and manageable pieces called components.
- **Declarative Syntax**: Makes code more predictable and easier to debug by describing the UI's desired state.
- **One-Way Data Binding**: Ensures data flows in a single direction, improving control over application state.
- **React Hooks**: Enables functional components to use state and lifecycle methods.

React is often used with tools like **Redux**, **React Router**, and **Next.js** to create dynamic and efficient web applications.
